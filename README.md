# Employee Retention Prediction Model

This project uses a multivariable logistic regression model to predict whether an employee is likely to stay or leave based on various features such as satisfaction level, average monthly hours, promotion status in the last 5 years, and salary.

## Data Source

The dataset used in this project is fictional and generated for the purpose of creating a demonstration for the Employee Retention Prediction Model. It does not represent real-world employee data. The features and patterns within the dataset are synthetically created to showcase the functionality of the logistic regression model.

Please note that the predictions made by the model on this fictional dataset are for illustrative purposes and may not accurately reflect real-world scenarios.
